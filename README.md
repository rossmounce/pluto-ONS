# pluto-ONS
An open science notebook of work on extracting phylogenetic tree data from the journal IJSEM

This the repo I use to store full raw output from `ami-phylo` tests on IJSEM phylogeny image files.

Each batch run is it's own subfolder within testing e.g.
[50 images batch output](https://github.com/rossmounce/pluto-ONS/tree/master/testing/50-images/50images-only)
[2700 image batch output](https://github.com/rossmounce/pluto-ONS/tree/master/testing/batch-20150821-output/all-input)

It's not very pretty
